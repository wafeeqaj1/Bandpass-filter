Authors: Wafeeq Jaleel, Tianxiang He

## Description
This was a project done for ECE 3090:Technical writing and presentation at the Ohio state university. Simulated passive elements in a band pass filter using TopSpice to obtain element values for 200kHz center frequency and 50kHz bandwidth then designed the PCB in KiCad based on the values. 

### Dependencies
* TopSpice (latest version)
* KiCad
